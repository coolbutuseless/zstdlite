Description: Fast, compressed serialization of R objects using the 'Zstandard' algorithm.
    The included zstandard connection ('zstdfile()') can be used to read/write
    compressed data by any code which supports R's built-in 'connections'
    mechanism.
    Dictionaries are supported for more effective compression of small data, 
    and functions are provided for training these dictionaries.
    This implementation provides an R interface to advanced features of 
    the 'Zstandard' 'C' library (available from <https://github.com/facebook/zstd>).
