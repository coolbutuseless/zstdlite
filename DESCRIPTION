Description: Fast, compressed serialization of R objects using the 'Zstandard' algorithm.
    R objects can be compressed and decompressed quickly using the standard 
    serialization mechanism in R.   Raw byte vectors
    and strings are also handled directly for compatibility with compressed data created
    by other systems and programs supporting 'Zstandard' compression.   
    Dictionaries are supported for more effective compression of small data, 
    and functions are provided for training these dictionaries.
